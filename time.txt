Samy Dafir:
    - General research (clahe, colorspaces, ...) and learning how to use OpenCv 
      (includes looking for java documentation): 10 hrs
    - Implementation of Preprocessing:
        first try: Trying to do an own implementation: 8 hrs
        Second Try: Using OpenCv: 5 hrs
    - Implementing KNN and "leave one image out": 3 hrs
    - Implementation of edge length algorithm, edge length histograms
      and required surrounding functionality: 9 hrs
    - Additional implementation to integrate all features within one single application:
      Also fixing errors in KNN and changing the implemented "leave one image out" to the required
      "leave one patient out"
